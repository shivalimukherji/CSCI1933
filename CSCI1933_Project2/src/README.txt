Contributions: I worked on this project on my own.
How to compile and run program: The Game class contains the main method to take user input and display the board. The display and print methods from the board class are called with a debug mode condition in the showBoard method. So, the game is run and played from the Game class.
Known bugs or defects: The submarine method in the Board class is missing one cell for a vertically oriented boat. Also, user input validation in the Game class. There is no condition that checks whether the user input for the type of attack is correct or not.
Assumptions: The entire board is set up with integer coordinates, and each cell of the board has an integer coordinates for x and y.
Outside Sources: No outside sources besides information from the labs and Professor Dovolis's lectures were used to write the code.
Additional features: No additional features were implemented in this project. However if I was given more time, I would have implemented a nicer graphical user interface using Java Swing.

I certify that the information contained in this README is complete and accurate. I have both read and followed the course policies in the 'Academic Integrity - Course Policy' section of the course syllabus.
